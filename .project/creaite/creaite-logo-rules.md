# creaite Brand Guidelines

## Typography Rules

### Rule #1: Case Sensitivity
- **Lowercase:** `creaite` is ALWAYS written in lowercase in all contexts EXCEPT banners and report headings
- **Uppercase:** Only written as `CREAITE` when displayed in:
  - ASCII art banners or logo displays
  - Report headings (Variant 4: Minimal Inline Version)

### Rule #2: AI Emphasis
- The "AI" portion of the name should be visually distinguished when possible
- In logos: Use contrasting colors, gradients, or styling for "AI" section
- In text: Can use subtle formatting like cre**ai**te or cre*ai*te for emphasis

### Rule #3: Color Palette
- Primary: Dark Teal (#115e59 → #0e7490)
- AI Accent: Gold/Amber (#b45309 → #f59e0b)
- Background: Dark (#111827 or similar)
- Text: Light gray to white (#e5e7eb to #ffffff)
- IMPORTANT: "AI" portion is ALWAYS displayed in GOLD when colors are available

### Rule #4: Logo Variations
- Full Banner: UPPERCASE with ASCII art (dark teal with gold "AI")
- Inline Text: lowercase always
- Compact Inline Display: ALWAYS in BOLD with dark teal + gold "ai"
- **Report Headings: UPPERCASE Variant 4 (CREAITE) for all reports and dashboards**
- Icons: Emphasize the "ai" portion in gold
- Taglines: Always lowercase (e.g., "creaite - where ideas become reality")

### Rule #5: Spacing & Kerning
- Never split the word: ❌ cre-aite, cre aite
- Never add spaces: ❌ c r e a i t e
- Maintain consistent letter spacing in logos

### Rule #6: File Naming
- Use lowercase for all file names: `creaite-logo.svg`
- Use hyphens for separation: `creaite-brand-guidelines.pdf`
- Never use camelCase or underscores for creaite assets

### Rule #7: Domain & Digital
- Domains: creaite.com, creaite.ai, creaite.dev
- Social handles: @creaite (all lowercase)
- Hashtags: #creaite #creaiteai (no capitals)

### Rule #8: Pronunciation Guide
- Phonetic: /kree-AY-t/
- Emphasis on "AI" sound in the middle
- Rhymes with "create" but with AI emphasis
