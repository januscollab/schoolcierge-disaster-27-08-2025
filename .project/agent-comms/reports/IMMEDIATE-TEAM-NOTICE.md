## SEVERITY: P0 - CRITICAL

---

## ‚õî STOP ALL CURRENT WORK

### DO NOT USE THESE COMMANDS:

- ‚ùå Any auto-remediation features

### ‚úÖ SAFE COMMANDS TO USE:

- ‚úÖ `git status` - Check git state
- ‚úÖ Direct JSON viewing of backlog.json

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED

### What's Happening:
The `cx status` command's auto-healing feature is **actively corrupting task data**:
- Tasks marked as completed are being reverted to in-progress
- Protected tasks (verified: true) are being modified
- False health warnings triggering unwanted "fixes"
- Progress percentages being reset

### Current Damage Assessment:
- **TASK-001**: Incorrectly showing as in-progress (has protection flags!)
- **TASK-002, TASK-005, TASK-009**: Reset to 10% progress
- **TASK-018, TASK-047**: Correctly showing as completed (not affected yet)

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NEXT 5 MINUTES)

### For Developers Currently Working:

1. **SAVE YOUR WORK**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "WIP: Emergency save before cx status fix"
   ```

2. **DOCUMENT YOUR CURRENT TASK STATE**
   - Note what you were working on
   - Record actual progress percentage
   - List any blockers or dependencies

3. **BACKUP YOUR LOCAL TASK DATA**
   ```bash
   cp .project/tasks/backlog.json .project/tasks/MY_BACKUP_$(date +%s).json
   ```

4. **CHECK THE COLLABORATION FEED**
   ```bash
   tail -30 .project/agent-comms/agents-collaboration-feed.md
   ```

---

## üîß FIX IN PROGRESS

### Timeline:
- **T+0-5 min**: Disable auto-healing (NOW)
- **T+5-15 min**: Assess full damage
- **T+15-45 min**: Implement fixes
- **T+45-60 min**: Testing
- **T+60-90 min**: Validation & deployment

### Who's Doing What:
- **Senior Developer**: Implementing code fixes
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and validation  
- **PM Agent**: Coordination and communication
- **Infrastructure Agent**: Monitoring for issues

---

## üì¢ COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Updates Every 15 Minutes:
- Check collaboration feed for progress
- Watch for "ALL CLEAR" notification
- Report any new issues immediately

### If You Find Issues:
1. DO NOT attempt to fix yourself
2. Document the issue clearly
3. Add to collaboration feed
4. Tag as INCIDENT-001 related

---

## üîÑ TEMPORARY WORKFLOW

### To Continue Working:

1. **View Tasks Safely:**
   ```bash
   # Use basic list command
   cx list
   
   # Or view JSON directly
   cat .project/tasks/backlog.json | jq '.[] | select(.status=="in-progress")'
   ```

2. **Update Task Progress Manually:**
   ```bash
   # Add to collaboration feed instead of using cx commands
   echo "## [$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')] - Manual Update" >> .project/agent-comms/agents-collaboration-feed.md
   echo "- TASK-XXX: Progress 50% - Implementing feature Y" >> .project/agent-comms/agents-collaboration-feed.md
   ```

3. **Start New Tasks:**
   ```bash
   # Use safe mode if available
   cx start TASK-XXX --safe
   
   # Or manually edit JSON (CAREFULLY!)
   # Make backup first, then edit
   ```

## ‚è∞ ESTIMATED RESOLUTION: 90 MINUTES

### Next Update: 17:25 GST (15 minutes)
### Full Resolution Expected: 18:40 GST

## üí° REMEMBER:

1. **Data is backed up** - No work will be lost
2. **This is fixable** - Solution already designed
3. **Stay calm** - Following the plan minimizes risk
4. **Ask questions** - Better to clarify than assume

## üìû ESCALATION CONTACTS:

- **Incident Commander**: PM Agent (current)
- **Technical Lead**: Senior Developer
- **Architecture**: Solution Architect
- **Testing**: QA Engineer

**THIS IS A TEMPORARY ISSUE. NORMAL OPERATIONS WILL RESUME SHORTLY.**

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
