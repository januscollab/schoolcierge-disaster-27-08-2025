# üö® EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN: CX Status Data Corruption
## PM Agent Incident Command Center

---

## INCIDENT SUMMARY
**Severity:** CRITICAL - P0
**Impact:** System-wide task management corruption affecting all development
**Detection Time:** 2025-08-27 16:15 GST
**Response Time:** 2025-08-27 17:00 GST (IMMEDIATE)
**Incident Commander:** PM Agent

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Data Corruption:** Auto-healing is actively corrupting task data
2. **False Reporting:** Status displays don't match actual task states
3. **Protection Bypass:** Verified tasks being incorrectly modified
4. **Developer Impact:** Team cannot trust task system

---

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (0-15 Minutes)

### Phase 1: STOP THE BLEEDING (NOW ‚Üí T+5 min)
**Owner:** Developer Team Lead
**Priority:** ABSOLUTE CRITICAL

1. **DISABLE AUTO-HEALING IMMEDIATELY**
   ```bash
   # Create emergency backup FIRST
   cp .project/tasks/backlog.json .project/tasks/backlog.EMERGENCY.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json
   
   # Comment out auto-healing in status command
   sed -i.bak '498,587s/^/\/\/ EMERGENCY DISABLED: /' .project/scripts/status-report-sexy.js
   ```

2. **VERIFY BACKUP CREATED**
   ```bash
   ls -la .project/tasks/backlog.EMERGENCY*.json
   ```

3. **COMMUNICATE TO ALL AGENTS**
   - Post to collaboration feed: "CRITICAL: cx status auto-healing DISABLED due to data corruption"
   - Slack notification if integrated
   - Update any active CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 2: ASSESS DAMAGE (T+5 ‚Üí T+15 min)
**Owner:** QA Engineer
**Priority:** CRITICAL

1. **Identify Corrupted Tasks**
   ```bash
   # Find tasks with verified flag that were modified
   grep -E '"verified":\s*true|"do_not_revert":\s*true' .project/tasks/backlog.json | \
   grep -B5 -A5 '"status":\s*"in-progress"'
   ```

2. **Document Impact**
   - List all tasks incorrectly reverted
   - Note actual completion status vs displayed status
   - Identify any blocked development work

3. **Create Recovery Map**
   - Which tasks need status restoration
   - Which tasks have lost progress data
   - Which tasks have incorrect dependencies

## üü° IMPLEMENTATION COORDINATION (15-60 Minutes)

### Phase 3: APPLY FIXES (T+15 ‚Üí T+45 min)
**Owner:** Senior Developer
**Support:** Solution Architect

#### Fix Sequence (STRICT ORDER):

1. **Fix #1: Disable Auto-Healing (T+15)**
   - File: `.project/scripts/status-report-sexy.js`
   - Lines: 498-587
   - Action: Remove entire auto-healing block
   - Verification: Run `cx status` - should NOT show healing messages

2. **Fix #2: Correct Status Calculation (T+20)**
   - File: `.project/scripts/status-report-sexy.js`
   - Method: `calculateMetrics()`
   - Action: Use actual task.status instead of recalculating
   - Verification: `cx status TASK-047` should show "completed"

3. **Fix #3: Add Protection Flags (T+30)**
   - File: `.project/scripts/auto-remediation.js`
   - All fix methods
   - Action: Add checks for verified/do_not_revert flags
   - Verification: Protected tasks remain unchanged

4. **Fix #4: Create Health Command (T+40)**
   - New file: `.project/scripts/health-check.js`
   - Action: Separate health checking from status display
   - Verification: `cx health` runs without modifying data

5. **Fix #5: Update Command Mappings (T+45)**
   - Files: `package.json`, `cx`
   - Action: Add new health commands
   - Verification: All commands route correctly

### Phase 4: TESTING & VALIDATION (T+45 ‚Üí T+60 min)
**Owner:** QA Engineer
**Support:** Test Automation Agent

#### Test Checklist:
- [ ] `cx status` shows correct task counts
- [ ] Completed tasks display as completed
- [ ] No auto-healing messages appear
- [ ] Protected tasks cannot be modified
- [ ] `cx health` runs read-only by default
- [ ] `cx health --fix` requires confirmation
- [ ] No data corruption after status check
- [ ] Progress percentages are accurate

---

## üü¢ QUALITY ASSURANCE (60-90 Minutes)

### Phase 5: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
**Owner:** QA Engineer

1. **Regression Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   npm test -- --testPathPattern="task-manager|status"
   ```

2. **Data Integrity Verification**
   ```bash
   # Compare before/after task states
   diff .project/tasks/backlog.EMERGENCY.*.json .project/tasks/backlog.json
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure status command execution time
   - Verify no memory leaks
   - Check for race conditions

### Phase 6: MONITORING SETUP
**Owner:** Infrastructure DevOps Agent

1. **Create Monitoring Alerts**
   - Task status changes
   - Unexpected data modifications
   - Health check failures

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all task modifications
   - Track which process made changes
   - Timestamp all operations

## üìù POST-MORTEM PROCESS (After Resolution)

### Within 24 Hours:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Why did auto-healing ignore flags?
   - How did this pass initial testing?
   - What monitoring gap allowed this?

2. **Lessons Learned**
   - Separation of concerns critical
   - Read-only operations should never modify
   - Protection flags must be absolute

3. **Prevention Measures**
   - Add integration tests for protection flags
   - Create data corruption detection
   - Implement change audit logging
   - Add confirmation prompts for all modifications

4. **Process Improvements**
   - Code review checklist update
   - Testing requirements enhancement
   - Monitoring coverage expansion

### Documentation Updates:
- Update TASK-MANAGEMENT.md with new commands
- Document protection flag behavior
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Create data recovery procedures
