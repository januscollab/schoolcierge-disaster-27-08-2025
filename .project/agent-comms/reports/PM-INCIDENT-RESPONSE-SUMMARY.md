## Executive Summary

As SchoolCierge Project Manager, I have initiated a **CRITICAL P0 incident response** for the cx status command data corruption issue. This is currently our **highest priority**, with all other development work paused until resolution.

### Incident Classification:
- **Severity:** P0 - CRITICAL
- **Impact:** System-wide, affecting all development
- **Scope:** Task management and reporting systems
- **Risk Level:** HIGH but manageable with immediate action
- **Response Time:** IMMEDIATE - 90 minute resolution target

---

## 1. Immediate Action Plan (0-90 minutes)

### Phase Timeline:

#### 🔴 IMMEDIATE (0-15 minutes)
1. **Stop the Bleeding**
   - Disable auto-healing in cx status command
   - Create emergency backups
   - Notify all team members
   - Pause all task updates

2. **Damage Assessment**
   - Identify corrupted tasks
   - Document incorrect states
   - Map recovery requirements
   - Quantify impact

#### 🟡 IMPLEMENTATION (15-60 minutes)
3. **Apply Fixes**
   - Sequential implementation of 8 specific code fixes
   - Protection flag enforcement
   - Separation of health checks from status display
   - Command mapping updates

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for each fix
   - Integration testing
   - Data integrity verification
   - Performance validation

#### 🟢 STABILIZATION (60-90 minutes)
5. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Gradual feature activation
   - 24-hour monitoring period
   - Audit logging enabled
   - Quick rollback ready

## 2. Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Identified Risks & Mitigations:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Further data corruption | Medium | Critical | Multiple backup levels, isolated testing |
| Fix introduces new bugs | Medium | High | Phased rollout, comprehensive testing |
| Lost productivity | Certain | Medium | Alternative workflows provided |
| Developer confusion | High | Medium | Clear communication every 15 minutes |
| Rollback failure | Very Low | Critical | Three-tier backup strategy |

### Protection Measures:
- **3-Level Backup System**: Local, Git, External
- **Phased Implementation**: Read-only → Protected → Separated → Full
- **Alternative Workflows**: Safe commands documented
- **Continuous Monitoring**: File change detection, integrity checks

---

## 3. Communication Plan

### Internal Team Communication:

#### Immediate (Completed ✅):
- Critical alert posted to collaboration feed
- Team notice document created
- Safe/unsafe commands documented

#### Ongoing (Every 15 min):
