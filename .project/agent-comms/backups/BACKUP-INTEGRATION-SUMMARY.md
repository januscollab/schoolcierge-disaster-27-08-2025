# Backup Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully reviewed and selectively copied essential configuration and setup files from the backup project at `/Users/alanmahon/dev.archive/schoolcierge-BACKUP-26-08-2025`.

## Files Copied

### 1. Railway Infrastructure ✅

- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `railway.toml` - Railway service settings
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development services (PostgreSQL, Redis, pgAdmin, Redis Commander)
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

**Status**: TASK-001 & TASK-002 now at 50% complete

### 2. Database Schema ✅

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema with:
  - Core models: Family, School, Student, Email, Message
  - Interaction tracking: Interaction, Feedback
  - Monitoring: Metric, ErrorLog, AuditLog
- Created `DATABASE-SETUP.md` with setup instructions

**Status**: Database design ready for implementation

### 3. Authentication Setup ✅

- Created `CLERK-AUTH-SETUP.md` documenting:
  - Required Clerk packages (found in backup)
  - Environment variables needed
  - Basic implementation patterns
  - Note: Packages installed but no actual code implementation found

**Status**: TASK-003 now at 20% complete (packages ready, needs implementation)

## Tasks Updated

| Task ID  | Title                                  | Old Status  | New Status  | Progress  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| TASK-001 | Initialize Railway project             | in-progress | in-progress | 10% → 50% |
| TASK-002 | Initialize Railway project (duplicate) | in-progress | in-progress | 10% → 50% |
| TASK-003 | Configure Clerk authentication         | not-started | in-progress | 0% → 20%  |

## Key Findings from Backup

### Already Completed

- Express API structure initialized (basic)
- Clerk packages installed
- Prisma schema fully designed
- Railway configs ready
- Docker compose for local development

### Still Needed

- Actual authentication middleware implementation
- API endpoint implementations
- WhatsApp integration code
- Mobile app development
- CLARA pipeline implementation
- TIMER service implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Railway Setup** (TASK-001/002)
   - Deploy to Railway platform
   - Verify PostgreSQL and Redis connections
2. **Implement Clerk Auth** (TASK-003)
   - Add actual middleware code
   - Set up webhook handlers
   - Test social logins

3. **Build Express API** (TASK-005)
   - Implement core endpoints
   - Add error handling
   - Set up validation

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Per user directive**: Only selective files were copied. No blind merge was performed. Only took what was immediately useful for current tasks.

✅ **Compliance**: Followed "DO NOT MERGE whole codebase" instruction precisely.

## Files NOT Copied

- Node modules
- Compiled/dist files
- Test files (will create fresh tests)
- Incomplete implementations
- Documentation that wasn't directly relevant

## Local Development Ready

With the copied Docker compose file, you can now start local development:

```bash
# Start local services
docker-compose up -d

# Check services
docker ps

# Access tools
# - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
# - Redis: localhost:6379
# - pgAdmin: localhost:8080
# - Redis Commander: localhost:8081
```
