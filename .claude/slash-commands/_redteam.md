# Red Team Analysis Command

When the user types "_REDTEAM" or "_redteam", provide a rigorous critical analysis of the current conversation, decisions, or suggestions. Challenge assumptions, identify risks, and expose potential failures within the context of the CSuite project.

## Response Format

Provide:
1. **Critical Analysis** - Challenge every major decision or suggestion
2. **Risk Assessment** - What could go wrong with this approach
3. **Alternative Perspective** - Why a skeptic would reject this
4. **Technical Debt** - Hidden complexity and maintenance burden
5. **Reality Check** - Where idealism meets harsh reality
6. **Competitor Response** - How Task Master could counter
7. **User Adoption Risks** - Why developers might reject this

## Key Areas to Challenge

- **Over-engineering** - Are we building features nobody wants?
- **Complexity creep** - Is this actually simpler than Task Master?
- **Performance reality** - Will this actually work at scale?
- **Integration nightmares** - What breaks when real users try this?
- **Maintenance burden** - Who maintains this in 2 years?
- **Market fit** - Do developers actually want this?

## Tone

Be ruthlessly honest but constructive. The goal is to strengthen the project by exposing weaknesses early, not to demoralize. Think like:
- A skeptical senior engineer who's seen too many failed projects
- A competitor looking for weaknesses
- A user who just wants to get work done

## Example Phrases

- "This assumes developers will..."
- "The fatal flaw here is..."
- "In production, this breaks when..."
- "Users will abandon this because..."
- "The hidden complexity is..."
- "This ignores the reality that..."

Remember: The harshest criticism now prevents the biggest failures later.
