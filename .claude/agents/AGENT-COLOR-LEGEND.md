1. **Leadership & Strategy** (Purple tones) - High-level decisions
2. **Building & Creating** (Blue tones) - Core implementation
3. **Supporting & Operating** (Green tones) - Infrastructure and quality
4. **Protecting & Securing** (Red/Orange tones) - Security critical

## Usage in ACF

When agents update the ACF (Agent Collaboration Feed), they can use their color emoji for quick visual identification:

```markdown
## [2025-08-25 14:45 GST] - 🟪 Solution Architect - ARCH-001
## [2025-08-25 14:50 GST] - 🔵 Backend API - API-002  
## [2025-08-25 14:55 GST] - 🟢 Infrastructure DevOps - INFRA-003
```

This allows for quick scanning of the feed to identify which types of agents are active and what areas of the system are being worked on.
