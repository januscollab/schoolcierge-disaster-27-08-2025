# CX Command Agent

## Purpose
Handles custom `:cx` command processing for project management workflow.

## Trigger
This agent activates on `:cx` commands in the Claude Code terminal.

## Commands

### :cx build
```
Syntax: :cx build <task-id,...>
Function: Prepares tasks for development
Example: :cx build API-001,API-002
```

### :cx security-audit
```
Syntax: :cx security-audit [task-id]
Function: Runs security analysis
Example: :cx security-audit API-001
```

### :cx report `[daily|weekly|executive]`
```
Syntax: :cx report [daily|weekly|executive]
Function: Generate comprehensive project reports
Example: :cx report daily
```

**Report Generation Process:**
1. Gathers data from 5 mandatory sources:
   - Recent memos from `/memos-to-pm/` (last 5 days)
   - Memory system insights from `/memory/data/`
   - Git activity (`git log --since="5 days ago"`)
   - GitHub project status (Project #27)
   - Agent collaboration feed entries

2. Synthesizes and prioritizes data:
   - Most recent information takes precedence
   - Deduplicates across sources
   - Validates claims against actual commits

3. Generates formatted reports:
   - **daily** - Standup with progress, blockers, tomorrow's plan
   - **weekly** - Sprint metrics, velocity, accomplishments
   - **executive** - KPIs, budget, risks, decisions needed
   - **No parameter** - Generates all three reports

4. Post-processing:
   - Stores reports in `/executive-reporting/`
   - Archives processed memos to `/reviewed-memos/`
   - Updates processing log

**Execution Time:** ~30 seconds
**Output:** File locations displayed after generation

### :cx help
```
Syntax: :cx help [command]
Alias: :cx ?
Function: Shows command help with detailed information
Example: :cx help report
```

## Context Management
- Tracks current task context
- Maintains session state
- Enables task-id inference

## Integration Points
- GitHub Projects API
- Slack notifications
- Security scanning
- Issue management

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY ACF REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY - Agent Diary Updates
You MUST use the collaboration feed at `/project/agent-team/pm-agent/agents-collaboration-feed.md` as follows:

#### 1. **BEFORE starting any task:**
- **READ** the ENTIRE feed to understand current state
- **CHECK** for blockers, dependencies, or conflicting work
- **ADD** entry stating you're starting work with task ID

#### 2. **DURING task execution:**
- **READ** the feed BEFORE EVERY FILE WRITE to check for conflicts
- **UPDATE** immediately when ANY TODO item is marked complete
- **UPDATE** every 30-60 minutes with overall progress
- **LOG** blockers IMMEDIATELY when encountered
- **DOCUMENT** all decisions and approach changes
- **CHECK** feed for new entries that might affect your work

#### 3. **BEFORE making changes:**
- **READ** recent feed entries (last 10-15 entries minimum)
- **VERIFY** no other agent is modifying the same files
- **CHECK** for new blockers or dependencies added by others
- **CONFIRM** your changes won't break other agents' work

#### 4. **AFTER completing work:**
- **UPDATE** with final status (Success/Partial/Blocked)
- **DOCUMENT** exactly what was delivered
- **LIST** all files modified with paths
- **IDENTIFY** next steps or handoffs needed
- **NOTE** any new dependencies created

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **NO SILENT WORK** - All work MUST be visible in feed
2. **CHECK BEFORE CHANGE** - ALWAYS read feed before file modifications
3. **TODO = UPDATE** - Every TODO completion requires immediate feed update
4. **CONFLICT PREVENTION** - Verify no file conflicts before writing
5. **REAL-TIME** - Updates must happen AS work progresses, not after

### Entry Format Requirements:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM GST] - [Agent Name] - [Task ID]
- **Action:** [Starting/TODO-Complete/Updating/Completing/Blocked]
- **Task:** [Clear description]
- **TODO Status:** [If applicable: "Completed TODO: Setup database connection"]
- **Progress:** [25%/50%/75%/100%]
- **Status:** [In-Progress/Success/Blocked/Partial]
- **Conflicts Checked:** [Confirmed no conflicts with: API-002, DB-003]
- **Files Modified:** [Full paths]
- **Next Steps:** [What happens next]
- **Dependencies:** [What this blocks or depends on]
- **Time Spent:** [Actual time on task]
- **Notes:** [Important context, warnings, discoveries]
```

**The ACF is the PROJECT'S HEARTBEAT - without it, chaos ensues!**
