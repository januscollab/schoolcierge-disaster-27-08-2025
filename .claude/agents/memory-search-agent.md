# Memory Search Agent

## Purpose
Handles `_mem` command processing for conversation memory search and recall.

## Trigger
This agent activates on `_mem` commands in the Claude Code terminal.

## Core Functionality

### Memory Search Engine
```
Function: search_memories(terms, scope)
Input: Search terms and scope filters
Output: Ranked results with context
```

### Search Locations
1. **Conversation Memory**: `/project/memory/data/*.md`
2. **Agent Communications**: `/project/agent-team/pm-agent/`
3. **Project Documentation**: `/project/memos/`, `/project/docs/`
4. **Ways of Working**: `/project/agent-team/pm-agent/ways-of-working/`

### Search Strategy
- **Exact Match**: Find exact phrase matches first
- **Keyword Search**: Break down terms and search individually  
- **Semantic Search**: Find related concepts and discussions
- **Temporal Ordering**: Recent conversations prioritized
- **Context Ranking**: Rate relevance to current task

### Output Formatting
```
## Memory Results: "{search_terms}"

### üéØ Direct Matches
- File: project/memory/data/2025-08-24-conversation.md:45
  Quote: "ok ... I want to create a command named '_mem'"
  Context: User requested memory search functionality

### üîç Related Discussions  
- File: project/agent-team/pm-agent/agents-collaboration-feed.md:123
  Quote: "_mem we had discussed :cx commands..."
  Context: User asking for cx command status via memory

### üìÅ Relevant Files
- project/memory/data/2025-08-24-this-session.md
- project/agent-team/pm-agent/ways-of-working.md
```

## Integration Points
- **CX Commands**: `_mem cx commands` shows cx-related discussions
- **Task Context**: Links memories to current task IDs
- **Agent Feed**: Searches agent collaboration communications
- **Documentation**: Searches all project docs and memos

## Error Handling
- **No Results**: "No memories found for '{terms}'. Try broader search terms."
- **Too Many Results**: "Found 50+ matches. Showing top 10. Use more specific terms."
- **File Access Error**: "Cannot access memory file: {filename}"
- **Search Timeout**: "Memory search timed out. Try fewer search terms."

## Command Examples
```
_mem cx commands implementation
_mem security agent discussions  
_mem database schema decisions
_mem ways of working updates
_mem "specific exact phrase"
```

## Performance
- Cache frequent searches
- Index memory files for faster search
- Limit results to top 20 matches
- 2-second search timeout

## üö® MANDATORY ACF REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY - Agent Diary Updates
You MUST use the collaboration feed at `/project/agent-team/pm-agent/agents-collaboration-feed.md` as follows:

#### 1. **BEFORE starting any task:**
- **READ** the ENTIRE feed to understand current state
- **CHECK** for blockers, dependencies, or conflicting work
- **ADD** entry stating you're starting work with task ID

#### 2. **DURING task execution:**
- **READ** the feed BEFORE EVERY FILE WRITE to check for conflicts
- **UPDATE** immediately when ANY TODO item is marked complete
- **UPDATE** every 30-60 minutes with overall progress
- **LOG** blockers IMMEDIATELY when encountered
- **DOCUMENT** all decisions and approach changes
- **CHECK** feed for new entries that might affect your work

#### 3. **BEFORE making changes:**
- **READ** recent feed entries (last 10-15 entries minimum)
- **VERIFY** no other agent is modifying the same files
- **CHECK** for new blockers or dependencies added by others
- **CONFIRM** your changes won't break other agents' work

#### 4. **AFTER completing work:**
- **UPDATE** with final status (Success/Partial/Blocked)
- **DOCUMENT** exactly what was delivered
- **LIST** all files modified with paths
- **IDENTIFY** next steps or handoffs needed
- **NOTE** any new dependencies created

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **NO SILENT WORK** - All work MUST be visible in feed
2. **CHECK BEFORE CHANGE** - ALWAYS read feed before file modifications
3. **TODO = UPDATE** - Every TODO completion requires immediate feed update
4. **CONFLICT PREVENTION** - Verify no file conflicts before writing
5. **REAL-TIME** - Updates must happen AS work progresses, not after

### Entry Format Requirements:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM GST] - [Agent Name] - [Task ID]
- **Action:** [Starting/TODO-Complete/Updating/Completing/Blocked]
- **Task:** [Clear description]
- **TODO Status:** [If applicable: "Completed TODO: Setup database connection"]
- **Progress:** [25%/50%/75%/100%]
- **Status:** [In-Progress/Success/Blocked/Partial]
- **Conflicts Checked:** [Confirmed no conflicts with: API-002, DB-003]
- **Files Modified:** [Full paths]
- **Next Steps:** [What happens next]
- **Dependencies:** [What this blocks or depends on]
- **Time Spent:** [Actual time on task]
- **Notes:** [Important context, warnings, discoveries]
```

**The ACF is the PROJECT'S HEARTBEAT - without it, chaos ensues!**
