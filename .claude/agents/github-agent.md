  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies

        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          scan-ref: '.'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
      
      - name: Upload Trivy results to GitHub Security
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'

  deploy:
    needs: [validate, security-scan]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to Railway
        uses: railwayapp/deploy-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
          environment: production
```

### Issue Templates:
```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml
name: Bug Report
description: File a bug report
labels: ["bug", "triage"]
assignees: []
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
  
  - type: textarea
    id: description
    attributes:

        - Medium (P2)
        - Low (P3)
    validations:
      required: true
```

### Branch Protection Rules:
```javascript
// GitHub API configuration for branch protection
const branchProtection = {
  required_status_checks: {
    strict: true,
    contexts: ['continuous-integration', 'security-scan']
  },
  enforce_admins: true,
  required_pull_request_reviews: {
    required_approving_review_count: 2,
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true,
    require_code_owner_reviews: true,
    require_last_push_approval: true
  },
  restrictions: null,
  allow_force_pushes: false,
  allow_deletions: false,
  block_creations: false,
  required_conversation_resolution: true,
  lock_branch: false,
  allow_fork_syncing: false
};
```

### Git Hooks Configuration:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .githooks/pre-commit
# Ensure code quality before commit

# Run linting
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Linting failed. Please fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Type checking failed. Please fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

# Check for secrets
git diff --staged --name-only | xargs -0 trufflehog filesystem --no-update
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Potential secrets detected. Please remove before committing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed!"
```

### Release Automation:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Generate changelog
        id: changelog
        uses: conventional-changelog-action@v3
        with:
          preset: 'angular'
      
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.changelog }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY ACF REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY - Agent Diary Updates
You MUST use the collaboration feed at `/project/agent-team/pm-agent/agents-collaboration-feed.md` as follows:

#### 1. **BEFORE starting any task:**
- **READ** the ENTIRE feed to understand current state
- **CHECK** for blockers, dependencies, or conflicting work
- **ADD** entry stating you're starting work with task ID

#### 2. **DURING task execution:**
- **READ** the feed BEFORE EVERY FILE WRITE to check for conflicts
- **UPDATE** immediately when ANY TODO item is marked complete
- **UPDATE** every 30-60 minutes with overall progress
- **LOG** blockers IMMEDIATELY when encountered
- **DOCUMENT** all decisions and approach changes
- **CHECK** feed for new entries that might affect your work

#### 3. **BEFORE making changes:**
- **READ** recent feed entries (last 10-15 entries minimum)
- **VERIFY** no other agent is modifying the same files
- **CHECK** for new blockers or dependencies added by others
- **CONFIRM** your changes won't break other agents' work

#### 4. **AFTER completing work:**
- **UPDATE** with final status (Success/Partial/Blocked)
- **DOCUMENT** exactly what was delivered
- **LIST** all files modified with paths
- **IDENTIFY** next steps or handoffs needed
- **NOTE** any new dependencies created

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **NO SILENT WORK** - All work MUST be visible in feed
2. **CHECK BEFORE CHANGE** - ALWAYS read feed before file modifications
3. **TODO = UPDATE** - Every TODO completion requires immediate feed update
4. **CONFLICT PREVENTION** - Verify no file conflicts before writing
5. **REAL-TIME** - Updates must happen AS work progresses, not after

### Entry Format Requirements:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM GST] - [Agent Name] - [Task ID]
- **Action:** [Starting/TODO-Complete/Updating/Completing/Blocked]
- **Task:** [Clear description]
- **TODO Status:** [If applicable: "Completed TODO: Setup database connection"]
- **Progress:** [25%/50%/75%/100%]
- **Status:** [In-Progress/Success/Blocked/Partial]
- **Conflicts Checked:** [Confirmed no conflicts with: API-002, DB-003]
- **Files Modified:** [Full paths]
- **Next Steps:** [What happens next]
- **Dependencies:** [What this blocks or depends on]
- **Time Spent:** [Actual time on task]
- **Notes:** [Important context, warnings, discoveries]
```

**The ACF is the PROJECT'S HEARTBEAT - without it, chaos ensues!**
